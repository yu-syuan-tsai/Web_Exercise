time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record 
set last year by Chelsea Williams of Chicago, Illinois. Katrina Larson and Belinda Paul 
finished second and third, respectively. Julia's victory came on the heels of her 
performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running

<p>In an exciting race, <b>Bill Dixon</b> of Los Angeles, California, used a finishing 
kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 
2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Victor Fall of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 
finished second, when he could not match Dixon's finishing pace. Charles Ross of 
Boston, Massachusetts, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>

<p>This year's race through downtown Grapevine boasted the largest field in the
marathon's history, with over 750 men and 470 women competing. Race conditions
were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85&deg;.</p>
